       "AIMessageChunk(content=\"For a vegetarian version of Chicken Tikka Masala, you can replace the chicken with a plant-based alternative such as tofu or paneer. Here's how you can prepare these alternatives:\\n\\n1. **Tofu**: \\n   - Use firm or extra-firm tofu for this recipe.\\n   - Drain the tofu and press it to remove excess water. You can do this by wrapping the tofu block in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels and placing a heavy object on top for about 15-30 minutes.\\n   - Cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes and follow the same marinating process as you would with chicken. Tofu absorbs flavors well, so the marination time can be similar to chicken.\\n   - Instead of baking, you can pan-fry the marinated tofu in a bit of oil until it's golden brown and slightly crispy.\\n\\n2. **Paneer**:\\n   - Paneer is a type of Indian cheese that holds its shape well when cooked.\\n   - Cut the paneer into cubes and lightly pan-fry them until they develop a golden crust. This step helps the paneer hold its shape better when added to the sauce.\\n   - You can also marinate the paneer cubes in the yogurt and spice mixture for added flavor.\\n\\nFollow the rest of the recipe as it is, substituting the chicken with your chosen alternative. The tofu or paneer will absorb the flavors of the aromatic spices and creamy tomato sauce, giving you a delicious vegetarian version of Chicken Tikka Masala. Enjoy your meal!\")"
